### 📊 Exploring Different Datasets with EDA

Hey there! 👋 This repo is all about diving into different types of datasets and exploring them through EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). I’ve used Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to clean the data, visualize it, and uncover interesting patterns and insights.

### 💡 What’s Inside:
- A bunch of **datasets** from different domains
- Cleaned and analyzed in **Jupyter Notebooks**
- Plenty of **graphs and visualizations**
- A few **summary notes** with key takeaways from each analysis

### 🛠️ What I Worked On:
- Handling missing data and outliers
- Understanding individual features and how they relate to each other
- Creating visual stories with data
- Highlighting trends and patterns

### 🧠 Why This Repo?
Whether you're just starting with data or looking to brush up your skills, these examples show how EDA helps make sense of data before jumping into modeling or decision-making.
